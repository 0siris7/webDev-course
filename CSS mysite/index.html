              <h2>Hello.</h2>
              <p style="color: #40514E;">Sekiro, also known as Wolf, or Ookami, is the eponymous protagonist of Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. He is a Shinobi serving the Divine Heir, Kuro. Bound by honour, he is composed and reticent, but also has the ruthlessness to complete his mission by any means necessary.</p>

                <h3>Shinobi Arts</h3>
                <p class="skillz">Shinobi Arts is a skill tree in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, this skill tree consists of skills that focus on stealth tactics, and will be the predominant Skill Tree for players who prefer to avoid direct confrontation, and would rather remain in the shadows killing in one strike. However, because Stealth is likely to play less of a role during Boss encounters, players should also invest in other Skill Trees as well.</p>

                <h3>Ashina Arts</h3>
                <p class="skillz">Ashina Arts (葦名流, School of Ashina) is a skill tree in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, this skill tree focuses on combat and swordplay. This is the Skill Tree for the player who plans to be in direct confrontation with enemies often, and who does not care too much for stealth tactics. Because Bosses are likely to be fought in this manner, placing some points into this Skill Tree is recommended to all players.</p>

              <h3>If ya wanna be a Shinobi</h3>
              <p>Set in the closing years of the Sengoku period, SEKIRO: SHADOWS DIE TWICE depicts a withered, yet vivid world spawned from a reinterpretation of Japanese-inspired aesthetic, where the battle unfolds for a solitary shinobi, bound by the code to protect his master.</p>
